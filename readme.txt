A template for the HTML editor that allows you to copy and paste authorship information about images into your posts.

== Description ==

This plug-in will let you add image credits to posts and pages. It does this by adding a button to your HTML editor called 'credit'. Pressing the button conjures up a form that will let you fill out fields about the image, such as the name of the creator, and the URL of the license under which you are using the image. 

Press submit, and the plug-in will paste a nicely formatted string to the end of your editor. 

I am currently a happy user of my own plugin, and forsee no major changes in the future. Please let me know if there is any feature you could use.

Note that currently only the text editor is supported.

= Why doesn't it work =

There could be a couple of reasons: 

1. You're using the Visual editor. At the moment only the Text editor is supported.
2. You have Javascript disabled or another Javascript program is interfering.

If the reason it doesn't work isn't in this list, please file a support request on the plugin's homepage. Please describe what you have tried (step for step) and where it goes wrong.
