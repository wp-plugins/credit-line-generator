A template for the HTML editor that allows you to copy and paste authorship information about images into your posts.

== Description ==

This plug-in will let you add image credits to posts and pages. It does this by adding a button to your HTML editor called 'credit'. Pressing the button conjures up a form that will let you fill out fields about the image, such as the name of the creator, and the URL of the license under which you are using the image. 

Press submit, and the plug-in will paste a nicely formatted string to the end of your editor. 

You could do this by hand of course, but I hope that this saves (a little) time, and that it will keep you from making typos.
